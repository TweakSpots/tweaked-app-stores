## Advantages of Tweaked App Stores

Alternative app stores for iOS devices offer a variety of advantages:

1. **Enhanced App Selection**: These platforms often provide access to a wider range of applications, including modified versions of popular apps and games that are typically paid on the official App Store.

2. **Bypassing Apple‚Äôs In-App Purchase Fee**: Apple imposes a 30% fee on all in-app transactions on the App Store. Utilizing alternative app stores can help circumvent this charge.
